				<h3>What is the Chinese Zodiac?</h3>
					The Chinese zodiac is a twelve-year mathematical cycle in which each year corresponds to a particular animal.  Each animal is said to have a particular set of characteristics that are inherited by those born in the corresponding year.  The Chinese zodiac traditionally starts with the year of the Rat followed by, in order, the Oxen, the Tiger, the Hare, the Dragon, the Snake, the Horse, the Sheep, the Monkey, the Rooster, the Dog and finally ending with the Pig. The Chinese utilized a sexagenary cycle, a list of 60 terms, for recording days and years. This resulted in a twelve year cycle and the difference between a year in the Gregorian calender and a year by the Chinese.
				<br />
				<br />
					Many Chinese people hold the belief that when you are born, many predictions can be made about your future based on the animal your birth year corresponds to such as what your personality type will be and how successful you will be in your future career. Also, it is believed that if the current year corresponds to the same animal as your birth year, you will recieve good luck and blessings throughout the year, for example, 2015 is currently the year of the Sheep, thus, all people born in the year of the Sheep should experience a fruitful year.

					This website will show you what sorts of characteristics people of a certain animal sign are said to share.
					
				<h3>What is my Zodiac sign?</h3>	
					Your Chinese Zodiac sign is derived from your birth year, according to the Chinese lunar calendar in a twelve year cycle. See the years of each animal below to determine your own sign. 
				<br />
				<br />
					Those born in January and February take care: Chinese (Lunar) New Year moves between 21 January and February 20. If you were born in January or February, check whether your birth date falls before or after Chinese New Year to know what your Chinese zodiac year is.
